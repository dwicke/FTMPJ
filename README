This is a port of Ibis/MPJ.  I fixed a bug with probing for and then recieving 
an array of Objects. In Ibis's release this caused a null pointer to be returned.
I found that in MPJObject that the method cast2ObjectArray only worked if the
MPJObject.buffer was a byte[]. I checked if the MPJObject.buffer is a Object[]
and then just copied the objects.

I am also working on providing a means within FTMPJ to allow
the MPI program to know when a connection is lost in order 
to not send data to a specific process. This will allow the user to produce
fault tolerant code.

I intend to use FTMPJ in MALSIM to provide multi processing capabilities. 

While working with iprobe I noticed that it was blocking. This was due to 
the fact that when checking if it should continue to look for messages
it checked the IPROBE opcode with the field opcode which was never set
to an opcode.  Rather the field mode is used to store the opcode
so I changed the check and it works.
