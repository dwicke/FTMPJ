This is a port of Ibis/MPJ.  I fixed a bug with probing for and then recieving 
an array of Objects. In Ibis's release this caused a null pointer to be returned.
I found that in MPJObject that the method cast2ObjectArray only worked if the
MPJObject.buffer was a byte[]. I checked if the MPJObject.buffer is a Object[]
and then just copied the objects.

I am also working on providing a means within FTMPJ to allow
the MPI program to know when a connection is lost in order 
to not send data to a specific process. This will allow the user to produce
fault tolerant code.

I intend to use FTMPJ in MALSIM to provide multi processing capabilities.
